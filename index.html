      <p class="textDeco1 centering responsive"> This album contains music based on Brooklyn drill and melodic rap emphasized through the chill vibes and emotions his voice evokes. With a guitar-led or sample-driven tone, he plays on nostalgic feelings that hit harder with the lyricism and flow of his rap.  </p>

      <p class="textDeco2 centering responsive"> The original album of laid-back flows through harmonization highlights Sleepy Hallow's trap style of an all around hitter who is still experimenting. Some songs included are ones that talk about the hardships of growing up in an underfunded and underprivileged area, sprawling raw emotions across its listeners. </p>
